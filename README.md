# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of the analysis is to create a summary of the differences in ride-sharing data based on the city type on a weekly basis. Using graphical visualizations, these differences will be displayed and provided to the decision makers at PyBer to aid high-level decision-making. 

## Results

#### Summary of PyBer Data
![summary]()

* Total Rides

Perhaps not surprisingly, the largest number of rides were in Urban areas. This makes sense as there is simplay a larger population density for Urban areas relative to the other city types. The trend in the data shows that the greater the population density, the more rides that occur.

* Total Drivers

Total Drivers follows the same pattern as Total Rides. That said, it is important to note that the Total Driver counts are lower for both the Rural and Suburban city types. Conversely, the Urban city types actually have more drivers than rides. This suggest that either Urban drivers are more likely to sign up and not commit to the role OR the supply of drivers is greater than the demand.

* Total Fares

In a very broad sense, Total Fares reflects the data of the Total Rides. That said, the overal value per ride is not consistent between city types.

* Average Fare per Ride and Driver

The Average Fare per Ride and Driver are unique amongst the PyBer Summary statistics as the Rural city types out perform both Suburban and Urban, respectively. This can suggest that either rates are simply higher in Rural areas (perhaps because of gas prices etc.) or, morelikely, that the average PyBer ride in a Rural city travels a greater distance than their more urbanized counterparts.

* Total Fare by City Type

Looking at the graph, all city types tend to follow a similar trend throughout the year. Rural cities tend to start the year slow and spike around late February like Urban and Subrurban cities. Urban cities tend to taper off closer to the end of April

## Summary

* Based on the significant number of Total Drivers in Urban areas in comparison to the Total Rides, it is apparent that there is a huge surplus of drivers. Not only does this skew the Average Fare per Ride and Driver for Urban city types, but it also means that there are a lot of idle drivers. This can either be a direct result of driver supply being greater than ride demand or low committment from Urban drivers. This would require further analysis to determine the actual cause. If the issue is the former, PyBer can raise the standards of drivers to reduce the suppl/demand gap while increasing quality of service without impact profits. If the issue is the latter, programs and/or incentives to encourage drivers to look for more rides is an option.


* While Ruraly cities tend to bring it lower Total Fare, looking at the Average Fare per Ride and Driver, we can see that the margin per ride is notably higher for Rural areas. As such, it may be worth it to place greater effort into expanding into Rural areas as these cities offer the best margins. It is important to note that Urban Average Fare per Ride and Driver is skewed due to the disparity between Total Rides and Total Drives for those city types.

* Looking at the Total Fare by City Type graph comparison, there is a notable spike during the end of March. Based on this data, it looks like more rides are needed during this time but the demand shortly drops off. It may be worth it to implement lower rates for the later months.
